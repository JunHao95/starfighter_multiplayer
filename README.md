This is an extension of project forked from https://github.com/asmith1979/starfighter_multiplayer

I will do the following enhancement to upgrade the game feature

1. An improve algorithm to generate power-ups (located in spawner.py)
2. An improve algorithm to generate enemy game character (located in spawner.py)
3. Better client authentication (only basic client IP authentication has been implemented at the moment)
4. Adopt code further so that it can be played over the internet instead of just via a LAN
